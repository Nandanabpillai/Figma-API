# The Diary Plugin
The project is a time-saver for both designers and developers. The project creates a miniature version of the diary elements, like Calendar, Bucket-list, etc. which can be used by the designer in his/her project. The user can select from the different functionalities, according to his need, and implement them in their design. 

This makes it easier for the user to implement basic functionalities of a journal entry system, wihtout the hassle of recreating the compoents again and again...

The user can use all the components and make the designs accordingly. Hence, this makes it easier for non-coder designer to use the settings effectively...

The user can also make necessary changes to the components, like designs and location, thereby adding a personal touch to the components...
